I finally went to see an optometrist this week. Catching up to normal life tasks after you move takes awhile.

It was a reasonably pleasant experience (except for the machine that puffs air in your eye).  I filled out a form about myself.  I sat in front of some machines, where my vision capabilities were measured and photographed.  My very nice optometrist asked me a series of questions about my vision, clearly trying to ferret out if I required specific resources or care.  

That's when it hit me.  This format is **exactly** how we (myself and my co-worker) first engage with researchers at UW Madison.  Our initial meeting with researchers who want to use [CHTC](http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu) computing resources is meant to assess research computing abilities and needs, and provide proper "treatment", so to speak.  We ask a standard set of questions to do this and, while we don't take photos of optical nerves, are trying to snapshot what researchers have, need, and will want in the future.  

I would never have thought of myself as a "doctor", but after my eye appointment on Friday, I realize that there are probably a lot of professions that require the practice of "diagnosis" (really just domain specific problem-solving) and I now have a new appreciation for what doctors do every day!
