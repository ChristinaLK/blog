When I taught a Software Carpentry workshop at UC-Boulder in early January, I ended the two days by giving a little bit of a motivational summary.  I opened with [this tweet](https://twitter.com/sarahmhird/status/552534138906234882) from the previous day's Software Carpentry instructor training, and I finished with  [Starlogs](http://starlogs.net/), to laughter and applause.  

But in the middle, I showed this:

[from a tumblr post](http://whatshouldwecallgradschool.tumblr.com/post/98911397272/when-i-successfully-debug-my-sas-code) with the caption "when I successfully debug my sas code."  

I put it up because I think that feeling^ is important.  That feeling when your code finally works, when all the dots appear from `nosetests`, when you're actually able to reuse a script because you wrote notes, when you restore an accidentally deleted directory, [when it only takes a few minutes to execute a task because you now have options besides excel](http://christinalk.github.io/blog/practice-what-you-preach.html).  One of the reasons I like knowing how to use a command line (besides its practicality) is the symbolic empowerment against my own insecurities about my identity as a computer user.  I started writing nicer code and version controlling and writing shell scripts not just because it was "right" or "practical" but because it made me feel good about myself.  

I feel smart and competent and badass when I know that I am using tools well to maximize my productivity, and that motivates me to continue using them.  It's not my only motivation, and it may not motivate everyone, but I think it's valid and should be something that we can talk about.
