I attended UW Madison's one-day [IT Leadership Conference](https://itlc.it.wisc.edu/) 
today, and finished off the day with a breakout session 
where an opening slide featured the "steps of 
competency" from a novice to an expert.  The steps of competency
 are not new to me - we cover them (indirectly) 
in the Software/Data Carpentry [Instructor Training](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/).  In brief, they are: 

* unconscious incompetency: a novice who doesn't even know what questions 
to ask to start understanding something. 
* conscious incompetency: someone who has some idea of what they don't know, but 
still can't really do the task at hand.  
* conscious competency: a practioner who knows enough to get the job done 
and has enough resources to fill in for what they don't know. 
* unconcious competency: the expert who "just knows" the answer and can 
use words like "obviously"

In the instructor training, we 
talk about the negative side of that last stage - unconcious competency - 
as it manifests in an expert blind spot.  As a teacher, it's my job to 
unearth my unconscious competencies, so that I can see what I take 
for granted, and where learners will struggle.  A simple example when 
teaching computing is typing speed.  I type without thinking - but not 
all learners do.  As a teacher, I have to recognize that blind spot in me 
and adjust my typing speed accordingly, so I don't overwhelm my learners.  

However, aside from its unhelpfulness in teaching, 
I've always assumed that the pursuit of competency is a good thing.  Even 
on the slide today, 
the steps to unconscious competency were exactly that - steps, moving 
upward.  The goal for the learner is always to be moving up those 
steps, maybe, hopefully, reaching that expert level.  

For no particular reason, today I stopped and thought about those assumptions: 
that the goal of life + learning is always competency, 
and that competency is good.  And I realized that these assumptions are not always 
true.  

There are lots of things we can learn, and in which we can 
become competent.  Programming, sure.  Management, leadership, yes!  But
what if the thing you 
are learning is something like trolling?  Manipulation?  Dominating 
the conversation?  Sarcastic, biting remarks?  Those things are learned too, 
just like the bash shell and scripting, and with practice, they can become 
areas of unconscious competence - blind spots.  

I think a lot of 
mental health treatment 
aims to expose our less outwardly malicious, but still destructive blind spots.  Mental 
health care 
unmasks the unconcious competencies (that 
we've learned so successfully!) that harm us, like refusing to ask 
for help, assuming that everyone is thinking the worst of us, or using unhealthy 
strategies to cope with life.  

Blind spots aren't just an issue for teachers to consider - they can be a problem 
for all of us, and they show that pure competency is not enough.  Competency 
in *what* matters.  Competency in service of *what end* matters.  It matters 
for ourselves and for the people around us.  

For me, this is a new way to frame my love of learning.  I love to learn and 
as a result I do want to be unconciously 
competent at a lot of things.  But before diving into a new learning experience, 
I now think I'll want to ask myself: what does an "unconsciously comptetent" person 
with this knowledge look like?  And do I want to be that person?
