Sometimes your mind wanders at work, and you think about questions 
like: 

> What are some of the most unexpectedly valuable skills you have learned 
> through a class you took or a job you had?  

Or maybe just me?  I think this question occurred to me because I had 
at least three immediate answers bubbling under the surface of my mind.  All 
three are skills from classes I took or research I did, skills 
which have proved formative, useful and durable.  As a theme, 
all three happened 
to be shared with me by 
talented and hard-working women, who I saw (and see) as 
role models.  

So in the spirit of paying it forward, my three skills are: 

## 1. Understanding Functions

I had a very gifted high school math teacher, from Algebra II through 
differential calculus, and one of the gifts she gave us was a
thorough grounding in what a mathematical function *is*.  I remember spending a 
significant amount of time on the topic, hammering home that a function 
is a **rule** that **assigns** one value to another value (but never 
to two values at once).  This was conveyed using math, prose, diagrams...pretty 
much any form to reinforce the idea.  

But it was worth it.  I didn't 100% get it, even with all that, but 
it was enough of a useful understanding to get me through quite a 
few math courses, even through undergrad.  It's the piece that I saw 
missing in so many of my first-year calc students and high-schoolers 
I tutored.  I feel very fortunate to have received that specific 
mental model because it was incredibly helpful, and eventually, extendable 
even to things like functional analysis.    

## 2. Giving Presentations

The summer after my sophomore year, I stayed at school and did 
some research.  The research itself was nothing to write home 
about - the real skill I learned that summer was 
how to give a presentation or talk about your research.  My colleague 
and I had to give official start and end of summer talks, and our 
advisor also 
made us give informal talks to some other math students doing 
summer research.  So we ended up giving a few talks, and she 
made us thoroughly prepare for each one.  We made slides, we 
practiced, we got feedback on how to most effectively convey our 
ideas, especially to an audience outside the field.  

The most valuable part of those presentations was not necessarily 
the concrete skills we learned (although those were a solid base 
for future learning) - rather, I took away that good, effective 
research talks were something that required work.  You can't just 
whip up a few slides and speak off the cuff; it 
takes time, care, and practice to get right.  I don't always make the 
time to prepare for presentations as I'd like, but it's still 
something that's important to me.  Taking the time to consider your 
message and be well prepared - to me, these 
are marks of professionalism and, most importantly, consideration and 
respect for your audience. 

## 3. Using Documentation

I still remember one of the assignments very early on in 
[Jenny Bryan's](https://twitter.com/jennybryan)
 [Stats 545](http://stat545.com/) course. In class, we had read in 
our data using `read.table()` and Jenny asked us to find out 
what options we would need to set in `read.csv()` to produce 
the same result.  The goal was not necessarily to replicate 
the function, but to force us to dig through a manual page 
(in this case, for `read.csv()` and actually read it.  

That turned out to be a really valuable lesson, because it taught me 
that I had reached a point where I could read documentation and that 
reading documentation might just be the most effective choice for me. It's 
so easy to get caught up in "google-this, google-that", but reading 
documentation has its own benefits: a) you're more likely to learn something, 
because you're methodically moving through information in context, 
and b) like browsing in 
a bookstore, you're more likely to find other random things you need by 
walking through a manual, instead of just "ordering up" the single 
solution via google.  I'm now at least 10x more likely to look up 
a function's spec instead of randomly googling to find out what I need 
to know.
