I wrote this up for the Software Carpentry instructor training guide, 
and it's short, and not a full-blown "teaching philosophy" in terms of 
pedagogical position, but it does represent a lot of who I am, and who 
I want to be.  

> I love ideas. As a mathematician, bibliophile, and general enthusiast
for most things, I am a self-proclaimed nerd---a term I use to mean
"someone who loves thinking, ideas, and learning new things."

> I love people (at least, I try). Most wisdom traditions, and my own
experience, tell me that I'm not here to live for myself, but that we're
all in this together.

> Most of all, I love sharing ideas with people. The best moments in life,
for me, are facilitating intellectual insights along with personal
connections. Those moments are what build a community that continues
living in hope and adventure, especially important in times of fear and
division. I teach to make those moments possible for myself and for
others. 

For those who are looking for a bit of a longer read, [Francis Su's](https://www.math.hmc.edu/~su/)
[wonderful speech on grace and teaching](http://mathyawp.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-lesson-of-grace-in-teaching.html) is 
a pretty fair representation of my own values as well.
