Slug: struggle
Authors: Christina Koch

It's been a week.  I've done a lot and slept not enough.  But 
more than that, it's been a week where every day takes effort, and 
basic things are still an uphill climb.  I paused in the middle 
of the day today and thought, "I'm struggling."  Just that.  Not 
a bad thing, or good thing necessarily, just a statement of fact. Today, 
it's a struggle.  I'm struggling.  

I've been thinking about struggle quite a bit recently.  Or rather, 
I've been thinking what the opposite of struggling is.  

Is it giving up?  Or something different?  I think I've lived a lot 
of time where if I wasn't struggling I had somehow given up (in 
a shameful way).  And I'm trying to replace that idea with another 
vision.  

The first is that the opposite of struggle is rest.  

The other is that the opposite of struggle *is* giving up, but not 
in resignation or defeat, but in acceptance and detachment.  
That is REALLY hard for me.
