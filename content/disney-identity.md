My treat of the week was going to see [Zootopia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948356/)
in the local second-run movie theatre ($3 tickets, woot woot!).  

It was great.  Going to the movies is always a good escape 
and Zootopia was the perfect mix (for me) of escaping into 
a fantastic and cleverly built world, while still gently 
addressing important issues (prejudice, stereotyping) 
in a thoughtful way. 

I've kept thinking about the movie, and some of those thoughts 
(weirdly enough) have been related to seeing the movie poster, which says 
Zootopia is by the folks who did [Frozen](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294629) and
[Big Hero 6](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2245084).  I know 
this is a standard animation studio practice 
(listing your most recent films), but the juxtaposition of those 
titles (and the knowledge that this branch of Disney animation also 
did [Wreck-It Ralph](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772341)) has made 
me think about what those movies 
have in common.  

Big Hero 6 is the oddball of the bunch; in the other three, I see 
a pattern of identity conflict.  In all three movies, 
the resolution to the story involves 
one or more main characters coming to terms with their identity, 
both internally and in relation to their world.  

* Zootopia: While the action of Zootopia 
is all about solving a 
crime, additional conflict comes from the culture's 
assumptions about particular species.  For main characters Nick and 
Judy, coming to terms with their identities
involves challenging cultural and individual 
assumptions about who they "are" or "should be".  Is Judy just a "token 
bunny" cop?  Can Nick, as a fox, be anything besides a hustler?  Those 
questions go hand in hand with the crime that the two are solving - the 
story resolves when they've both solved the crime and answered 
those questions about who they are.  
* Frozen: To the people in her world, Elsa is not the person she 
seems.  The conflict of the story is literally 
an identity conflict - Elsa runs away because her magical 
ability and her role as the crown princess are at odds.  That struggle 
is only resolved when Elsa is able 
to take one piece of her identity (magic) and use it in tandem with 
her other identities (sister, princess). [[1](#let-it-go)]
* Wreck-It Ralph: Both protagonists of Wreck-It Ralph - Ralph and Venellope - 
are dissatisfied with their current identities and, relatedly, their status 
in their worlds.  Both are outcasts - Vanellope as a "glitch" in her game and 
Ralph as the villain in his.  Ralph's pursuit of a new identity (as the hero) 
drives most of the story, at points dove-tailing (and at others conflicting with)
Vanellope's pursuit of what she believes to be her identity (a racer). Again, 
the resolution of the story comes when the identity conflicts are resolved: 
Vanellope's rightful identity is restored 
and Ralph can accept his role as "bad guy" because there's more to his
life than that role.  (Side note: pretty interesting that Vanellope and Ralph both 
need each other to achieve that resolution - Vanellope needs a champion and 
Ralph needs someone who loves him.)
* And if you want to go further 
back, [Tangled](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398286) was the first 
effort by this particular Disney animation cohort, and you see the same 
theme of main characters pursuing 
their identity: Flynn Rider goes from a VERY deliberately 
constructed identity of dashing 
bandit to his real self (Eugene) and has a shift of values (which impacts 
Rapunzel, as his actions result in a change of her identity as someone 
with magical powers).  

I know that
most (good) storytelling is built around character growth, 
where the protaganist changes by the end of the story, so this 
pattern might be much more prevelant in movies generally and I've 
just noticed it in this collection.  But it feels like these films 
are slightly different - that the *conflict* of the story 
is driven by underlying issues of identity and where the character's 
growth is specifically around **who they are** and their relationship 
to others instead of fixing some internal flaw or changing their 
mind about something.  

As a post-script: I have appreciated the clinically/socially 
accurate depictions of identity in these movies (the problems 
of repression in Frozen, the **excellent** language around bias 
and stereotype in Zootopia, the co-opting of 12 step program ideas 
in Wreck-It Ralph, and, to include a Pixar movie of the same 
general vintage, [Inside Out](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673) and its 
literal depiction of an emotional journey).  If this 
is part of a Disney plot to educate kids, and/or their parents, 
about what it means to know who you are and how to be in the world, 
I'd give it a thumbs up so far!

<a name="let-it-go">[1]</a> My grumpy "get off my lawn" self has always lamented that 
"Let It Go" exploded into such popularity, not for any musical 
reasons, but simply because the song represents only a piece of the 
movie's message and taken on its own, is a unhelpful way to 
think about forming your identity.
