At the end of the day today, my colleage Lauren and I were discussing 
the upcoming Data Carpentry workshop that we'll be hosting at the University 
of Wisconsin - Madison.  Talking over the order of material (spreadsheets, 
OpenRefine, then SQL, and ending with a day of R), we realized that we liked 
having SQL before R because it introduces one new thing (slicing and dicing 
tabular data) without the added mental overhead (cognitive load, if you prefer) 
of "programming in R".  We hope that this ordering 
will allow participants to first learn the basics 
of extracting information from tables (using SQL), focusing solely on what 
it means to "select" columns or "filter" data from rows, without worrying too 
much about what's going on under the hood.  We can then reinforce 
those ideas in the R lesson, but the focus can be on R, dataframes, and 
dplyr instead of the nuts and bolts of querying tabular data generally.
