My roommate and I are both introverts, and she has done
a lot of research and work around accommodations and access for 
"disability" of all stripes.  A few weeks ago we were talking 
about both these things and half-jokingly came up with some 
ideas for making life less stressful for introverts or people 
with social anxiety.  So 
without further ado, here are three suggestions: 

> Caveat: This is a bit tongue-in-cheek; my occasional discomfort as an introvert 
is in no way comparable to other ways in which our world is inaccessible 
due to ability, age, race, gender, etc. More than anything, this is an 
exercise in thinking creatively about how we could do things differently, 
in a way that makes a difference for a particular group.

## 1. Store Guides

I already have this actually.  My local Copps has a store guide 
hanging at the end of most aisles, so I can look up where 
items are without having to ask anyone. 

This may sound like a small thing, but some days I just don't have 
the energy to ask a stranger where the peanut butter is, and that 
low energy level frequently corresponds with my ability (or lack thereof)
to find the peanut butter in the first place.  

For larger stores, it could be a map.  I would love to have a map of 
my local Target, with an index of common items, because I can never find 
what I'm looking for.  

## 2. Silent Hairdressers

Some people like chatty stylists at the salon, but both my roommate and 
I agree that when we're getting our hair cut, we'd rather just sit 
in silence and enjoy the feeling of being cared for. 

My proposal: this is just another one of the questions they ask you 
before you get your hair cut: "How long? Do you want to trim the bangs? 
Conversation or no conversation?"  So easy.  Salons could even advertise: 
"We feature both silent and conversational hair stylists".  

This should be a thing.  

## 3. "Quiet Time" at Conferences

This one is born out of the past week teaching and helping at the 
[Open Science Grid User School](https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Education/OSGUserSchool2016).  I love the user
school.  I like the material, I like the students, I like teaching 
and explaning these concepts.  

But being around people **all day** is absolutely exhausting.  The 
same thing happens to me when I go to conferences.  I cannot do people-time 
all day without a break.  

So, like my friends who had an "introvert's corner" at 
their wedding reception, where guests who needed a break could go color 
and read, it would be awesome if all conferences had not only quiet 
spaces, but actual, scheduled downtime, where there was NO programming.  And 
that time should be in the middle of the day - not in the evening, when 
the expectation is that you go out with people and be simultaneously social 
and professional (which is more tiring than being either one of those 
things separately).  

-----------

That's it! The wishlist of introvert accommodations, part 1.  

I write all this, and have to acknowledge that sometimes it's a good 
thing to be uncomfortable, to push your boundries, and to grow.  It might 
not be a bad thing for me to find a store employee and actually ask for 
help; I have had my hair cut and enjoyed a very pleasant conversation 
with the stylist.  

But the options are fun to think about.  :)
