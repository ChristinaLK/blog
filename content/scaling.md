It was interesting to read [this tweet](https://twitter.com/sternbergh/status/743065220646612996) today
(as retweeted by [@gvwilson](https://twitter.com/gvwilson)).  It made me 
think because a) it's a helpful perspective on the different ways that 
'gun control' can happen and b) it captures a paradox of 
living in a highly technological world - the issue of scale.  

Not everything scales.  Despite the proliferation of automated and outsourced 
tools and resources (MOOCs, tweetbots, customer service in India, automated 
phone systems), there are some things that simply can't be scaled.  Background 
checks for AR-15s.  Education (in my opinion).  Medical care.  
You *can* scale those things.  But to do so is...unwise.    

It feels obvious when I say it out loud (or to my computer screen), but 
at the same time...not obvious?  Because so many of the technological 
forces of the world pursue scale at the expense of individual consideration 
and attention, I feel like the assumption that I must/should sacrifice the 
excellence of particularity for the effeciency of automation is baked into 
my sub-conscious.  Most of the time, I accept it without thinking.  I 
don't really notice when institutions try to scale everything.  

The idea of scale - when to sacrifice depth for breadth echoes the old
debate between those who favor local government/control versus federal 
government/control.  Do you create national laws that are perhaps most 
"correct" but inflexible to local particularities?  Or do you allow local 
groups to create their own laws - allowing them to address the particularity 
of their situation?  Those are the roots of the liberal/conservative 
divide.  

I think a lot about this re: SWC/DC as well.  

Of course there are benefits to "scaling up."  It feels vaguely 
ironic to talk about the downsides of scaling when my day job is all about 
helping people scale up!  I help researchers transition their computations 
from one machine to many, sometimes in a way that transforms 
their research.  And there are probably many other cases where 
a technology was automated 
or made accessible and the resulting growth really helped people.  

However, having said that I help people scale up, in some ways, my 
position is deliberately *not* about scale.  Some might think a "scalable" 
approach to helping researchers would be to simply provide documentation 
or online training - to have one person do help desk support and fix things 
as they come up.  "Scalable" here means - address as much as possible with 
as little human power as possible.  
But my position is almost the opposite.  Our approach is to help researchers 
help themselves, which involves a lot of one-on-one interactons, either in 
person or over email.  It doesn't seem "scalable" or efficient - it takes 
a TON of time to work with researchers and teach them how 
to solve their own problems.  But ultimately - this scales the best.  Our 
researchers solve their own problems, or better yet, help their colleagues.  

Where do you put your resources?  When do you say say "we will 
dedicate money for a person to do this, because it cannot be done in a
automated (scaled-up) way?"  When do you plant your foot and say 
"this cannot be scaled upward and we will remain small"?  And how to 
accomplish that last goal, when the forces of technology(/capitalism/humanness) 
push us the other way?
